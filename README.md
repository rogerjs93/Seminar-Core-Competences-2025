# 📚 Seminar Core Competences 2025

Welcome to the assignment submission portal! This repository is designed for anonymous, optional, and collaborative student submissions.

## 📝 How It Works

- For each assignment (`assignment1/`, `assignment2/`, ...), you can create your own folder using any pseudonym or identifier you wish.
- You may submit as many files as you want in your folder.
- To give or receive feedback, use the `notes.md` file in your folder.
- **Do not delete or edit anyone else's files or folders. Only admins can delete files.**
- All contributions are optional and can be anonymous.

## 📦 Assignments
